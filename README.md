# AltTrackr2
### A better, smaller cryptocurrency portfolio tracker

This project is being developed open source from start to finish and is licensed under GPL-2.0. <br />
AltTrackr2 uses the CryptoCompare API to fetch live price data on coins and fiat. <br />

##### AltTrackr2 can...
* Give you the current price of up to four selected coins in any fiat currencies (AUD, USD, GBP, EUR and many more)
* Track your portfolio, giving you the current value of your holdings in any fiat currencies
* Transfer funds between several different cryptocurrencies (powered by ShapeShift)
* Hold 190+ wallets, and securely transfer funds between addresses from within AltTrackr (powered by Bittrex Exchange)
* Get you hyped by sending current price notifications at any chosen interval (daily, weekly .etc)
* Notify you when your coin or holdings reach a certain value
* Track your current mining performance and profits through the Awesome Miner API
* Track your mining rig(s), including down GPUs or ASICs and current temperatures
* Probably some other stuff I haven't thought of yet...

##### Initial Support:
* 1000+ cryptocurrencies
* 190+ Wallets
* Conversion between 70+ cryptocurrencies

#### Active development on AltTrackr has ceased. This project has evolved into a far more comprehensive trading platform, CoinTrek. CoinTrek will be available at https://cointrek.app.
